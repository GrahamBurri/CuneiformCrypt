# CuneiformCrypt
This application will encrypt and decrypt data serialized and/or encrypted according to the Babylonian base-60 numbering system in conjunction with Babylonian cuneiform script, which is established in Unicode (U+12000-U+123FF). The project is composed of two parts:
  1. An application which provides a user interface
  2. A library containing functions and data structures related to CuneiformCrypt
  
 The library will be published as a NuGet package to allow for others to utilize this numbering system (for some reason).
